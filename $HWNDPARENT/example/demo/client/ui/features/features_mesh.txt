<lmargin%:5>The work-horse of the Torque Game Engine, the mesh rendering engine does it all.  Use single mesh and hierarchal mesh part shapes for players, vehicles, guns, projectiles, trees, rocks, you name it.  Add multiple complex animation sequences and even blend between multiple active animations!
