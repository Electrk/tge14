<just:left><font:Arial Bold:18>Terrain Rendering Engine<font:Arial:16>
<lmargin%:5>The Terrain system can render truly spectacular vistas with impressive visual distance.  Using the in-game editors you can quickly generate realistic heightfields and cover with textures many kilometers of terrain with a few mouse clicks. The screen error based and continuous LOD mesh reduction keeps the poly count low, the mesh rock solid and the distance visibility high.
