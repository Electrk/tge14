<lmargin%:5>Nothing adds to the visual quality of a scene like a huge body of water with twinkling sun reflections.  Use the World Editor to place any number of water blocks in your world then adjust the "dials" to perfect your look: everything from churning lava to crystal clear still water.  The water integrates seamlessly with player characters and vehicle models.
