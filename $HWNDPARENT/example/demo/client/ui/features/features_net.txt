The Torque Game Engine has a strong foundation built into the code for multiplayer games.  This award winning network code has been recognized by press and developers alike as being one of the most efficient and responsive multiplayer codebases available.  Easily support dozens of players, with support for hundreds of players attainable with close attention to detailing and bandwidth usage (Tribes2 used this code to support 128 player servers).  Key features of Torque networking code are: support for multiple data delivery requirements, partial object state updates and an efficient packet delivery notification protocol.

<font:Arial Bold:18><lmargin%:2>Torque Network Library (API)<font:Arial:16><lmargin%:5>
Torque Network Library allows developers to take the Torque Game Engine's networking code to the next level. The Torque Network Library (TNL) is a robust, secure, easy to use cross-platform C++ networking API designed for high performance simulations and games. TNL is designed to be easy to integrate into existing products. In less than an hour, you can have a minimal TNL implementation up and running in your game or network product. Within weeks you can take advantage of all the advanced features of the TNL, allowing your game to support more players while using less bandwidth per client than any other solution on the market.

More information about TNL can be found at <a:www.garagegames.com/pg/product/view.php?id=37>GarageGames</a> and <a:www.opentnl.org>OpenTNL.org</a>.
