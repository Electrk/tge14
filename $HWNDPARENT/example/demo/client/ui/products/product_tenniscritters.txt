RocketBowl Plus puts a futuristic twist on the traditional bowling experience. Bowl across the rolling contours of the RocketBowl Dome at the 1958 Kalamazoo Worlds Fair. Use special rocket-powered bowling balls to curve, boost, and hop your way over hills, around water traps, across bridges, and through winding chutes, all at a fun and relaxing pace. Knock over special 'dollar pins', collect bonus coins, and wager on matches against local pros to fatten your wallet and buy more advanced RocketBowl balls.
