Trophy Hunting 5 was the most realistic hunting simulation available when released, and still remains a leader in the genre today.  Developed at Dynamix in parallel with Tribes2, TH5 was released in the summer of 2000.  The Trophy Hunting Team used the <font:Arial Bold:16>Torque Game Engine<font:Arial:16> virtually as is, adding only specialized tree and foliage rendering code to enable them to display densely populated forests with unprecedented visibility.
